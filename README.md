**#About Me**  

Hello! I'm Elius Bokhtier, a web developer passionate about crafting clean, modern, and interactive web experiences. I love solving problems, turning ideas into reality, and learning new technologies along the way.
When I’m not coding, you’ll find me experimenting with design, traveling, playing video games, riding, or tinkering with electronics. My goal is to keep building products people love to use.
